# Atomicity-

- Atomicity is a property of database transactions that ensures that a series
of operations within a transaction are treated as a single, indivisible unit.
- This means that either all operations within the transaction are completed successfully,
or none of them are applied to the database.
- If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back,
leaving the database in its previous state.
